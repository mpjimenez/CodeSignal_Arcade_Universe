One night you go for a ride on your motorcycle. At 00:00 you start your engine,
and the built-in timer automatically begins counting the length of your ride, 
in minutes. Off you go to explore the neighborhood.

When you finally decide to head back, you realize ther's a chance the bridges on
your route home are up, leaving you stranded! Unfortunately, you don't have your
watch on you and don't know what time it is. All you know thanks to the bike's 
timer is that n minutes have passed since 00:00.

Using the bikes timer, calculate the current time. REturn an answer as the sum
of the digits that the ditial timer in the format hh:mm would show.

- Example
  For n = 240, the output should be lateRide(n) = 4.

  Since 240 minutes have passed, the current time is 04:00.
  The digits sum up to 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4, which is the answer.

  For n = 808, the output shoud be lateRide(n) = 14

  Since 808 minutes have passed, the current time is 13:28 now,
  so the answer is 1 + 3 + 2 + 8 = 14.

- Input / output
  - [execution time limit] 0.5 sec (cpp)

  - [input] integer n
    The duration of your ride, in minutes. It is guranteed taht you've been
    riding for less than a day (24 hours)

      Guaranteed Constraints:
        0 <= n <= 60 * 24

  - [output] integer
    The sum of the digits the digital timer would show.
