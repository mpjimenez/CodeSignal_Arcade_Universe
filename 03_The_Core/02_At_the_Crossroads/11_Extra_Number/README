You're given three integers a, b, and c. It is guaranteed that two of these
integers are equal to each oher. What is the value of the third integer?

- Example
  For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be 
  extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7;

  The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7,
  which is the answer.
