Given integers a and b, determine whether the following pseudocode results in 
an infinite loop.
   while a is not equal to b do
    increase a by 1
    decrease b by 1

Assume that the program is executed on a virtual machine which can store arbitrary
long numbers and execute forever.

- Example
  For a = 2, and b = 6, the output should be 
  isInfiniteLoop(a, b) = false;

  For a = 2, and b = 3, the output should be
  isInfiniteLoop(a, b) = true.

- Input / output
  - [execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

  - [input] integer a 
    Guaranteed Constraints: 0 <= a <= 20

  - [input] integer b 
    Guaranteed Constraints: 0 <= b <= 20

  - [output] boolean
    - true if the pseudocode will never stop, false otherwise.
