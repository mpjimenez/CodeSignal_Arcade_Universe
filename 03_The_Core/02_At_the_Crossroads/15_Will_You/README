Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line
was "Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?". Mary 
believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and 
beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put
her belief to the test.

Knowing wheter a person is young, beautiful, and loved, find out if they
contradict Mary's belief.

A person contradicts Mary's beliefs if one of the following statements
is true:
  - They are young and beautiful but not loved
  - The are loved but not young and beautiful

Example
  For young = true, beautiful = true, and loved = true, the output should be
  willYou(young, beautiful, loved) = false;

  Young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's beliefs.

  For young = true, beautiful = false, and loved = true, the output should be
  willYou(young, beautiful, loved) = true;

  Mary doesn't believe that not beautiful people can be loved.
