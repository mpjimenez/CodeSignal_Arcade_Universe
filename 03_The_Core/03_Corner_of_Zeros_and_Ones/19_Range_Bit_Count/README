You are given two numbers a and b where 0 <= a <= b. Imagine you construct an
array of all the integers from a to b inclusive. You need to count the number
of 1s in the binary representation of all the numbers in the array.

Example
  For a = 2 and b = 7, the output should be rangeBitCount(a, b) = 11.

  Given A = 2 and b = 7 the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
  Converting the numbers to binary, we get [10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111],
  which contains: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11 (1's)

- Input / Output 
  - [execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)
  
  - [input] integer a
    Guaranteed Constraints: 0 <= a <= 10.

  - [input] integer b
    Guaranteed Constraints: a <= b <= 10

  - [output] integer
