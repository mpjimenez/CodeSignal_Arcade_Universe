In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted 
message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that,
when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missle into the sky blocking
out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their 
binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the k^th
bit from the right was initially set to 0, but it's current value might
be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the
k^th bit of n back to 0.

Example
  For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be killKthBit(n, k) = 33.

  37 (base 10) == 100101 (base 2) --> 100001 (base 2) == 33 (base 10)

  For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be KillKthBit(n, k) = 37

  37 (base 10) == 100101 (base 2) --> 100101 (base 2) == 37 (base 10)
  since the 4th bit was already a zero, nothing changed.
