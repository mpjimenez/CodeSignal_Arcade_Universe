In the popular Minesweeper game you have a board with some mines and those
cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the 
total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Staring off with some
arrangement of mines we want to create a Minesweeper game setup.

- Example
  For matirx = [[true, false, false],
                [false, true, false],
                [false, false, false]]
  
  the output should be:
    minesweeper(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                           [2, 1, 1],
                           [1, 1, 1]]

  
- Input / Output

  - [execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

  - [input] array.array.boolean matrix
    - vector<vector<bool> matrix for C Plus Plus

     A non-empty rectangular matrix consisting of boolean values
     - true if the corresponding cell contains a mine, 
       false otherwise

    - Guaranteed constraints:
      2 <= matrix.length <= 100
      2 <= matrix[0].length <= 100

  - [output] array.array.integer
    - vector<vector<int>> for C Plus Plus

    - Rectangular matrix of the same size as matrix each cell of which
      contains an integer equal to the
