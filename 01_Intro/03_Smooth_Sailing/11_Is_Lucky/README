Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is
considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the
sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if its lucky or not

Example:
  - For n = 1230, the output shoud be isLucky(n) = true;
  - For n = 239017, isLucky(n) = false;

  - [Execution time limit] 0.5 sec (cpp)
  - [input] integer n
    - A ticket number represented as a positive integer  
      with an even number of digits.
    - guranteed constraints: 10 <= n < 10^6

  - [output] boolean
    - true if n is lucky, false otherwise
