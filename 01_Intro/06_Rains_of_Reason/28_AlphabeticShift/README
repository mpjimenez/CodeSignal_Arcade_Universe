Given a string, your task is to replace each of its characters by the next one
in the English alphabet; i.e. replace a with b, replace b with c, 
etc. (z would be replaced with a).


- Example
  - For inputString = "crazy", the output should be 
    alphabeticShift(inputString) = "dsbaz";

- Input / Output 
  - [execution time limit] 0.5 sec (C Plus Plus) 

  - [input] string inputString
    - A non-empty string consisting of lowercase Enlgish characters
  
    - Guranteed Constraints:
      1 <= inputString.length <= 1000

  
  - [output] string
    The resulting string after replacing each of its characters.
