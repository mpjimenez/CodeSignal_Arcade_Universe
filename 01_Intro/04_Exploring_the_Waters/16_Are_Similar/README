Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping
at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

Example: 
  - For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be 
    areSimilar(a, b) = true;
    The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements

  - For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
    areSimilar(a, b) = true.
    We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

  - For a = [ 1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
    areSimilar(a, b) = false.
    Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make 
    a and b equal.
