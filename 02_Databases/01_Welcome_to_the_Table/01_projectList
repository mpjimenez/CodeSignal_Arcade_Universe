Your boss wants to identify the successful projects running in your company,
so he asked you to prepare a list of all the currently active projects and
their average monthly income.

You have stored the information abut these projects in a simple database with
a single Projects table that has five columns:
  1) internal_id : the company's internal identifier for the project
  2) project_name : the official name of the project
  3) team_size : the number of employees working on the project
  4) team_lead : the name of the project manager
  5) income : the average monthly income of the project

Your boss says that the internal project ids are irrelevant to him and that he
isn't interested in how big the teams are. since that's the case, he want you
to reate another table by removing the interal_id and team_size columns from
the existing Projects table. Return it sorted by internal_id in ascending order

- [Example]
    For the following table Projects
  
    internal_id       project_name    team_size     team_lead        income
      1384            MapReduce          100       jeffery Dean          0
      2855            Windows           1000       Bill Gates       100500
      5961            Snapchat             3       Evan Spiegel       2000

    The resulting table should be

    project_name        team_lead         income
    MapReduce          Jeffery Dean            0     
    Windows            Bill Gates         100500 
    Snapchat           Evan Spiegel         2000
