Students at your university get scholarships that are paid out throughout the
year. 

Information about the scholarships is stored in the table scholarships, which
has the structure:
  - id : the unique student id
  - scholarship : the amount of the annual scholarship the student has been
                  awarded

Now you need to calculate the amount of money each student should get per
month. Given the table scholarships, build the resulting table as follows:
The table should have the same columns as the initial table, but the
scholarship column should contain the amount of the students monthly
scholarship payout. the rows should be ordered by the students' id's.

- Example
  For the following table scholarships

  id            scholarship
  1              12000
  2              18000
  3              24000
  4              15000
  5              21000
  6              13000


  The output should be

  id            scholarship
  1               1000
  2               1500
  3               2000
  4               1250
  5               1750
  6               1083.3333333333
