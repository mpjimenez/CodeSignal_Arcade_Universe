Given the age of a person and the adulthood age in a particular country, 
determine if the person is considered an adult in that country. Note that
people whose age is the same as the adulthood age are considered adult.

Example
  For age = 18 and adulthood = 21, the output should be
  isAdult(age, adulthood) = false;
