Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested)
parentheses in the input string.

Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()'s.

Example
  - For inputString = "(bar)", the output should be 
    reverseInParentheses(inputString) = "rab";

  - For inputString = "foo(bar)baz", the output should be
    reverseInParentheses(inputString) = "foorabbaz";

  - For inputString = "foo(bar)baz(blim)", the output should be
    "foorabbazmilb"

  - For inputString = "foo(bar(baz))blim", the output should be
    "foobazrabblim" because
      "foo(bar(baz))blim" becomes "foo(barzab)blim" and  then becomes
      "foobazrabblim"

  - Input / output
    - [Execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

    - [input] string inputString
      - A string consisting of lowercase English letters and the characters
        '(' and ')'. It is guaranteed that all parentheses in inputString form 
        a regular bracket sequence

    - [output] string
      - Return inputString, with all the characters that wer in parentheses reversed.
