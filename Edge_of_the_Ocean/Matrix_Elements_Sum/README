After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building 
together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free,
but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots 
are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any 
of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the
cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all the rooms that are 
suitable for the CodBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).

Example:
matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2],
          [0, 5, 0, 0]
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]

The output should be matrixElementSum(matrix) = 9. (5 + 1 + 1 + 2) = 9
