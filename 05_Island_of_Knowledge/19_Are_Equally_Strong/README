Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights thay are able to lift ar equal.

Call two people equally strong if their strongest ars are equally strong
(the strongest are can be both the right and the left), and so are their
weakest arms.

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if 
you two are equally strong.

- [Example]
  - For yourLeft = 10, youRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15, and 
    friendsRight = 10, the output shoud be
    areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;

  - For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, friendsRight = 10
    areEquallyStrong(yourleft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;

  - For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, friendsRight = 9
    areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false;

- [Input / Output]
  - [Execution time limit] 0.5 sec (cpp)

  - [input] 4 integers 
      1. yourLeft
      2. yourRight
      3. friendsLeft
      4. friendsRight

      - Guaranteed constraints
        0 <= the 4 integers above <= 20

  - [output] boolean
    - true if you and your friend are equally strong, otherwise false
