You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles 
situated on a straight line. 

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right.
You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by 
some integer.

find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles

- Example
  - For inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be 
    avoidObstacles(inputArray) = 4.

- Input / Output
  - [execution time] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

  - [input] array.integer inputArray
    - vector<int> for C plus plus
    - Non-empty array of positive integers

    - Guaranteed constraints:
       2 <= input.Array.length <= 1000
       1 <= inputAray[i] <= 1000

  - [output] integer
    - The desired length of jump. 
    - REMEMBER: all jump lengths are determined by the length of the first jump.
