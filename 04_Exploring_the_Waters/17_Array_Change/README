You are given an array on integers. On each move you are allowed to increase
exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required
to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input

- Example:
    - For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
      arrayChange(inputArray) = 3;

- Input / output
  - [execution time] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

  - [input] array.integer 
    vector<int> for C Plus Plus
  
    - Guaranteed constraints:
      - 3 <= inputArray.length <= 10^5
      - 10^5 <= inputArray[i] <= 10^5

  - [output] integer

    - The minimal number of moves needed to obtain a strictly increasing
      sequence from inputArray.

    - It's guranteed that for the given test cases the answer always fits
      in singed 32-bit integer type.
