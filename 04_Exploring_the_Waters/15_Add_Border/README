Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

Example
  - For picture = ["abc", "ded"], the output should be 
    - addBorder(picture) = ["****",
                            "*abc*",
                            "*ded*",
                            "****"   
                           ]

Input / output
  - [execution time] 0.5 sec (cpp)

  - [input] arrat.string picture
    - vector<string> for C Plus Plus
    - Guaranteed Constraints:
      1 <= picture.length <= 100,
      1 <= picture[i].length <= 100.

  - [output] array.string
    - vector<string> for C Plus Plus
    - The same matrix of characters, framed with a border of asterisks of width 1.
